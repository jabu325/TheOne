						<p>We integrate your social media accounts with your website as standard. This means that your website can include links to your social media accounts, feeds from those accounts and we will add social sharing links under things like products and news stories so your visitors can share your content to a wider audience. </p>
						<p>If you do not yet have social media accounts it is quite straightforward to create these accounts and we can provide guides on how to do this. To make your social media accounts stand out and also match your new website's design we can produce header and profile images for each of the platforms with our <a href="https://www.webfactory.co.uk/dialogs/social-media-design">social media design</a> service. This service has a small one-off fee.</p>

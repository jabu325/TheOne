						<p>We always recommend where possible the images used on your site are images you have taken yourself. These images tend to be more tailored to your business and so help convey your business identity better. You can supply unlimited images for use on your website.</p>
						<p>If however you do not have images or need more general filler images, you can use stock library images on your site. An example might be if you wanted an image of a city skyline on your home page, this sort of image might be hard to take yourself but there is likely to be many available in our stock library.</p>
						<p>Depending on the package tier you select your website will come with a number of stock images included. If your package does not include stock images as standard you can add our <a href="https://www.webfactory.co.uk/dialogs/photo-pack">photo pack</a> which includes 20 images for a one-off fee.</p>
						<p>You can view and search the available images on the <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iStockPhoto website</a>.</p>

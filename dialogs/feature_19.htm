						<p>We use what we call our Welcome Pack to help us gather information about your business and understand your requirements. The Welcome Pack not only collects the information we require but also guides you in explain what you are looking for.</p>
						<p>The Welcome Pack is very straightforward to complete and can be done online through your web browser. We do however offer an Assisted Welcome Pack process for customers who perhaps don't feel comfortable doing things online or value the interaction completing the pack with one of our team can offer.</p>
						<p>You can choose the route which you prefer with all packages. The Assisted Welcome Pack is included with the Premium package as standard or can be added to any other package for a one-off fee of Â£129+VAT</p>
						<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.webfactory.co.uk/dialogs/our-process">our website build process</a>.</p>
						<p><strong>If you are unsure if you require the Assisted Welcome Pack, we recommend having a go with the online route and you can always upgrade later if you require.</strong></p>
